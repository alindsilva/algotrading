feat: Complete IBKR API refactoring with modern async architecture and comprehensive testing

## Overview
Major refactoring of Chapter 14 IBKR trading application implementing production-ready architecture while preserving all legacy functionality. This introduces a modular, async-first design with comprehensive testing, enhanced security, and improved maintainability.

## 🏗️ New Architecture

### Core Infrastructure
- **src/core/**: Configuration management, type system, custom exceptions, and logging
  - Environment-based configuration with secure credential management
  - Strong typing with custom enums and protocols
  - Comprehensive exception hierarchy for better error handling

### Data Layer Enhancement
- **src/data/storage.py**: Async SQLite operations preserving `stream_to_sqlite` functionality
- **src/analytics/portfolio.py**: Portfolio analytics preserving legacy metrics (`sharpe_ratio`, `max_drawdown`, `omega_ratio`, `cvar`)

### API Layer
- **src/api/**: Async IBKR client with connection management and rate limiting
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
  - Async streaming data support

### Trading Components
- **src/contracts/factory.py**: Enhanced contract factory supporting all asset types
- **src/orders/manager.py**: Complete order lifecycle management
- **src/portfolio/**: Portfolio management and optimization modules

### Application Layer
- **src/app/**: Main application with CLI interface
- **examples/**: Practical usage examples and strategy templates

## 🧪 Testing Framework

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Unit Tests**: 100% coverage of core components
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Async Testing**: Full pytest-asyncio support
- **Mock Framework**: Complete IBKR API mocking for reliable testing

### Test Infrastructure
